    <p>The MD4SG initiative will give a tutorial at the <a href="http://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2020kampala/schedule/#session-papers">Data Science Africa Summer School</a> (DSA'20), showcasing work focused on and relevant to the African continent, as presented by the leaders of different MD4SG working groups. The MD4SG online working groups have served as a backbone of MD4SG over the years, fostering interdisciplinary work, and bridging research and practical applications focused on improving access to opportunity in disadvantaged and marginalized communities.</p>
<p>The tutorial is taking place on July 29th, 9 - 11 AM EAT. Registration information can be found on the <a href="http://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2020kampala/logistics/">Data Science Africa</a> website.</p>
<h2>Working Group Presentations</h2>
<h3>Environment and Climate Change</h3>
<p>The climate crisis negatively impacts vulnerable populations the most. The <em>environment and climate working group</em> focuses on potential solutions that require interdisciplinary input (teamwork) in order to improve the welfare of these vulnerable communities. In this talk, we will overview our group's mission and highlight research opportunities at the intersection of data science, mechanism design, and sustainable development policy, especially in the African context.</p>
<p><em>Presentation by Wanyi Li and Lily Xu.</em></p>
<h3>Global Perspectives on Inequality</h3>
<p>The global perspectives on <em>inequality working group</em> seeks to combine economics, machine learning, and optimization perspectives to understand the causes and solutions to resource disparities. This year, the group has focused on two fundamental questions: when should we provide a resource to the vulnerable, and how do we identify worthy recipients? This talk will discuss some standard approaches to these problems, and highlight new dimensions from the group's own research.</p>
<p><em>Presentation by Samuel Taggart.</em></p>
<h3>Developing Nations</h3>
<p>The <em>Development</em> working group fosters collaboration and discussion amongst practitioners and academics to understand and tackle issues pertaining to the role and application of technology in addressing challenges in emerging nations and under-resourced settings. We study how techniques from algorithm and mechanism design, computational social science, and optimization can inform and help advance existing development policies and practices. In this talk, we'll give an overview of ongoing research within the group, and delve into a current project aimed at optimising COVID testing strategies in resource-constrained settings.</p>
<p><em>Presentation by Francisco Marmolejo-Cossio.</em></p>
<h3>Data Economies &amp; Data Governance</h3>
<p>The <em>Data Economies</em> working group within MD4SG is composed of a vibrant group of researchers and practitioners who are either based in or lead networks of research across the African continent. The group currently has two ongoing projects: Data Sharing and Data Platform. While the Data Sharing project explores nuanced barriers, including issues of trust, uneven power dynamics, and data colonialism that pose challenges to data sharing across the continent, the Data Platform project is working to deploy a data browser tool that will offer a platform for African scholars and practitioners to share, host, and visualise their data.</p>
<p><em>Presentation by Abeba Birhane and George Obaido.</em></p>
