<h2>Workshop Description</h2>
<p>Our FAccT 2021 CRAFT session, &quot;Narratives and Counternarratives on Data Practices in the Global South,&quot; is an interactive workshop that uses storytelling as a method to question common assumptions around data practices in countries and communities that are often grouped as &quot;the Global South.&quot; Building on our current project around <a href="https://facct2021.hotcrp.com/doc/facct2021-final239.pdf?cap=0239alaqgO6lnEe4">data sharing in Africa</a>, -- and our own autoethnographic observations in other countries -- we will provide various theme-based stories that are informed by common narratives around data practices and invite participants to challenge these narratives from various angles including historical contexts and cultures, legal limitations, accessibility, impact assessments, accountability mechanism, and more.</p>
<p>Our post-conference plan is to create &quot;Narratives and Counternarratives on Data Practices in the Global South&quot; story cards. Our hope is that these cards then will be used by data science educators, civil society groups, philanthropic groups, inter-governmental organizations such as the UN agencies to expose them to narratives and counternarratives of data practices in the Global South and inform them about challenges before they embark on any new initiatives or partnerships.</p>
<p>The CRAFT Workshop is taking place on <strong>March 5th, 6-7:30 PM (UTC)</strong>. Registration information can be found on the <a href="https://facctconference.org/2021/registration.html">ACM FAccT website</a>.</p>
