<h2>Workshop Home</h2>
<p>The first workshop on <strong>Mechanism Design for Social Good</strong> (MD4SG '17) will be held in conjunction with the <a href="http://sigecom.org/ec17/">18th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC '17)</a> at MIT in Cambridge, MA on June 26, 2017, and will feature invited speakers, paper presentations, and a panel discussion with researchers in the EconCS community.</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> The EC community has made great contributions both to the development of theoretical foundations and applications of mechanism design. Key application domains have so far included ad auctions and electronic commerce, cloud computing, fair division, kidney donation, and school choice. In this workshop, we will focus on a set of promising applications of mechanism design that deal with <em>access to opportunity</em> including low-income housing, refugee resettlement, healthcare, and education. In each of these domains, the government and citizens design allocation policies, impose tax structures, create laws, and regulate activities. These are all mechanism design problems with the unifying property that progress has the potential to significantly improve societal welfare.</p>
<p>The workshop will have three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invited talks from domain experts in fields such as public policy and economics.</li>
<li>Presentations of submitted papers by members of the EC community.</li>
<li>A panel of researchers with experience applying theoretical insights to areas with social good objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this workshop is fourfold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expose the EC community to new research directions through invited talks.</li>
<li>Engage the workshop attendees with domain experts to foster future learning and collaboration opportunities.</li>
<li>Jointly brainstorm and formalize research problems that the community can work on.</li>
<li>Highlight existing work in the community that falls under this theme.</li>
</ol>
<p>More generally, we see this workshop as part of a broader goal to create and raise interest in different mechanism design problems with a social good objective.</p>

<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
<p>The 1st Workshop on Mechanism Design for Social Good will be taking place at this year's ACM Conference on Economics and Computation at MIT on June 26, 2017. The goal of this workshop is to understand domains where tools from mechanism design have the potential to impact social good. During this year's workshop we will focus on mechanisms that <em>improve access to opportunity</em>. We aim to highlight domains that have been relatively unexplored by the EconCS community. We invite paper submissions broadly related to these themes, including theoretical and applied mechanism design work as well as empirical research that suggests future directions for mechanism design in these domains.</p>
<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include but <strong>are not limited to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>allocating low-income housing</li>
<li>allocating health insurance funds, managing access to healthcare, and pricing medical treatments</li>
<li>work on health insurance markets that highlights market design issues</li>
<li>redistributive mechanisms to mitigate economic inequality</li>
<li>understanding and increasing intergenerational mobility</li>
<li>mitigating unequal economic outcomes in online labor markets</li>
<li>detecting existence or causes of exploitative market behavior in online labor markets</li>
<li>evaluating students, teachers, or schools</li>
<li>design of transportation systems to reverse trends impacting inequality</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions will be evaluated on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevance to this workshop and its theme.</li>
<li>Novelty of domain.</li>
<li>Potential for follow-up work in the EC community: those from other communities who feel they fit this criterion are especially encouraged to submit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Authors may submit papers that are already under review or accepted in conferences or journals. There will be no published proceedings.</p>
<p>Authors will be asked to submit up to 250 words on EasyChair summarizing their results and relevance to the workshop. In addition, submissions will be accepted as a PDF and may be either working papers or papers that have been published at an established conference or journal. We do not require submissions to be in the EC format. If published, please include citation as to where it was published on the first page. The committee reserves the right not to review all the technical details of submissions.</p>

He is visiting Yale University as a Visiting Senior Research Scholar and Lecturer in the economics department and law school, where he teaches a joint economics-computer science course, &quot;Designing the Digital Economy&quot;. Glen's research aims to draw on tools from adjacent disciplines, such as law, computer science and philosophy, to develop practical proposals to expand the scope of efficient markets. For example, Glen developed a market mechanism for group decision-making, Quadratic Voting (QV), and has proposed a replacement for private property that combats its tendency to create monopoly power. He is drawing these themes together with his most common collaborator, University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner, into a book, Radical Markets, that offers a comprehensive package of policy ideas to respond to the current crisis of the liberal order and is under contract with the Princeton University Press. He also is co-founder of, Eric and Kevin Slavin of Collective Decision Engines, a start-up that commercializes QV for market research applications.</p>
