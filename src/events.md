The EAAMO Bridges community organizes workshops and other events at conferences as part of a boarder goal to create and raise interest in using algorithmic and mechanism design techniques, along with insights from other disciplines, to help improve access to opportunity for communities of individuals for whom opportunities have historically been limited.

These events are aimed at highlighting exemplary work from the EAAMO Bridges and related communities and to create a space where an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners can come together to brainstorm holistic solutions to problems impacting historically under-served and marginalized communities.

We strongly encourage all individuals interested in the broader EAAMO Bridges mission to participate in these events. We also welcome thoughts and suggestions about how we can best accommodate participants from institutions and organizations that might not have historically participated in similar workshops and events.
