talktitle: Measuring the Long-run Impact of Cash Transfers
talkapstract: Cash transfer programs are the prime example of a social innovation that has scaled rapidly across the globe. Such programs often have multiple objectives, from providing short-term safety nets to the long-term ambition of breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty. A lot of empirical evidence has been accumulated on the short term goals. 25 years after the start of the first national programs in Mexico and Brazil, we can also start taking stock of the long-term objectives. This presentation will first discuss the methodological challenges for studying long-term returns, focusing on common pitfalls and potential solutions. It will then lay out a framework to consider the different pathways and mechanisms towards long-term returns to clarify the type of outcomes and contextual variables to measure both on the intermediate and long run. Given the complexity and multi-dimensionality of the theory-of-change for long-term impacts, we then draw lessons from different studies, following the framework. We first highlight the evidence on long-term returns to conditional cash transfers (CCTs) that operate through returns on investments in education and skills. A lot of this evidence draws on the first generation of CCTs in Latin America, but we also link to the emerging evidence from other regions. We then turn to evidence on unconditional cash transfers (UCTs), which is particularly prominent for Sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on a wider set of investments and behavioral changes with evidence on impacts years after the end of the transfers.
