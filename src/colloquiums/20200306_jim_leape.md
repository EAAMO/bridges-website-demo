talktitle: Harnessing Global Markets for a Transition to Sustainability
talkapstract: Global markets have been vital engines of economic growth. They have also driven massive depletion of natural resources, such as forests and fisheries, and the escalation of greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, we've seen NGOs multinational companies, and sometimes international organizations and governments, work together to harness global markets to spur a transition to sustainability. In this session we'll explore efforts to address deforestation and overfishing. We'll look at how these collaborations have been able to drive change and consider some of the challenges they face in translating commitments into action and taking action to scale.
