talktitle: Fact-Based Policy - How Do States and Local Governments Accomplish It?
talkapstract: There is growing demand for a genuinely accountable government which, even with limited resources, delivers programs and policies with meaningful, measurable impact. Rapid advances in technology support the use of data and science in the private sector to develop insights about what people need, innovate products and policies to meet those needs, and then measure their success. Government has the potential to be similarly impactful, prompting recent federal and state calls for government to use a data-driven approach to produce efficient and effective policy solutions. But how can state and local governments use data and science to deliver improved results to their constituents? This talk will highlight the key challenges to creating and supporting fact-based policy at the state and local level, and will outline solutions and lessons learned from an innovative and scalable partnership model developed with the state of Rhode Island.
