talktitle: Type three social change - tech's role in tenant organizing at JustFix
talkapstract: JustFix's work building anti-eviction web apps early in the pandemic led us to change our philosophy on how tech can best serve tenants. We experienced the mismatch between legislative and software dev cycles (not the way you'd think.), the limits of organizing within the system, and the power of open data to put external pressure on bad landlords and brokers. In this talk, we'll preview some of JustFix's new tool ideas that fit this "type three" paradigm of working outside existing systems to push for housing justice. The discussion will be moderated by Daniel Waldinger in bridging social, economic, and policy perspectives on public housing allocation.
