talktitle: On the use of operations research methods for the design of school districts
talkapstract: Operations research methods have been used to identify and evaluate solutions to the reconfiguration of public school attendance area boundaries for over fifty years. The talk will explore connections between evolving issues in public education and advances in optimization, computing and geographic information systems, beginning with early work motivated by Supreme Court decisions to desegregate schools. We will also discuss how the limitations of early models and solution approaches hindered their applicability. The years since have seen new research directions to address additional challenges related to the design of school attendance boundaries and leverage emerging advances in technology. The talk will end with a reflection on current issues facing public school districts, including school busing and return-to-school plans amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ways in which operations research can be part of these discussions.
