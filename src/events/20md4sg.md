## Call for Participation

The 4th Workshop on Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG ’20) will take place virtually on **17-19 August 2020**.

The goal of the workshop is to highlight work where techniques from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from other disciplines, have the potential to *improve access to opportunity* for historically underserved and marginalized communities. The workshop will feature keynote presentations, contributed talks, and a virtual poster session on work at this research interface. The event aims to facilitate interactions between academia, policy, and industry with a focus on *bridging research and policy*; to this end, there will also be presentations of problem pitches and demonstrations as well as networking and discussion opportunities.

We solicit submissions of research papers, position and policy papers, as well as special problem- and practice-driven submissions, to be presented at the workshop. The deadline for submissions is **Wednesday, July 1**.

We encourage submissions from across various disciplines covering domains including bias and discrimination, civic participation, computational sustainability, developing nations, economic inequality, education, healthcare, housing, labor markets, and privacy and security. Submissions can be research papers introducing new theory or applications. We also strongly encourage submissions of position papers synthesizing existing work and perspectives or highlighting future directions, as well as problem pitches and demonstration submissions that are particularly aligned with policy or practice. Submissions will fall into one of four tracks:
- **AI and Machine Learning** including bias, fairness, and ethics, fair division and resource allocation, human computer interaction in socio-technical systems; multi-agent systems, privacy and security, computational social choice, and statistical reasoning.
- **Empirical Studies and Policy** including applied machine learning, causal inference, computational social science, empirical analysis of real-world systems, empirical methods, experimental results, and papers on policy interventions informed by empirical methods, as well as empirical validation of policy interventions.
- **Theory** including algorithm design, fairness and resource allocation, game theory, market and mechanism design, optimization, operations management, social choice theory, social network analysis, and theory of machine learning.

The last track is for special submissions such as problem pitches or demonstrations. We especially encourage individuals from government and policy, as well as individuals in non-government organizations and industry, to submit to this track.
- **Problems and Demonstrations:**
    - **Problem Pitches** including white papers on problems arising in practice that deserve wider academic attention, and papers pitching methods for addressing real-world problems through research.
    - **Demonstrations** including prototyped and/or deployed software systems and mobile platforms.

For all submissions, topics of interest include **but are not limited to**:
- market design challenges in resource-constrained settings
- measuring and evaluating progress to achieve sustainable development goals
- reducing inefficiencies in smallholder farms and under-resourced supply chains
- design of algorithms that mitigate bias and improve diversity
- allocating health insurance funds and managing access to healthcare
- equitable provision of scarce healthcare resources
- ethics of using solutions informed by algorithm and mechanism design in public sector settings
- market regulations for data and privacy
- algorithmic proposals to encourage civic participation
- evaluating fairness in electoral representation
- mechanisms and policy-based interventions with the aim of reducing systemic socioeconomic inequality
- mitigating unequal economic outcomes in on- and off-line labor markets
- detecting existence or causes of exploitative market behavior in on- and off-line labor markets
- allocating low-income housing assistance
- evaluating students, teachers, or schools and improving allocation of educational resources
- design of public and shared transportation systems
- design of flexible and equitable supply chains for food allocation

### Submission Specifications:
- **Research Papers**: Submissions should make theoretical and/or empirical contributions to previously studied problems or propose new ones motivated by societal applications.
- **Position Papers**: Submissions should propose open problems or explore understudied perspectives in the intersection of mechanism design, algorithms, optimization and fields such law, policy and philosophy.
- **Problem Pitches**: Submissions should provide
    - background information on the problems,
    - examples of how techniques for resource allocation, definition of appropriate metrics and objectives, design of systems, alignment of incentives, and related issues could significantly alleviate these problems, and
    - summary of any existing methods or approaches for addressing these problems. Submissions are also encouraged to provide a discussion of challenges in providing holistic solutions and/or introduce new methods for addressing the problems.
- **Demonstrations**: Demo submissions should be accompanied by a short description describing the system or platform, the problems it seeks to address, and the potential to use the tool in conjunction with algorithm and mechanism design and related tools to improve access to opportunity. Submissions should also include instructions for using the system or platform.

**Submissions will be evaluated on the following criteria:**

- **Research and Position Papers**:
    - Quality of submission as measured by accuracy and clarity of exposition.
        - Relevance to MD4SG and the workshop theme of bridging research and policy.
        - Novelty of domain: we particularly encourage work on applications that have been less explored within the fields of algorithms, optimization and mechanism design.
        - Significant positive consideration will be given to submissions with:
            - Potential for policy-oriented follow-up work. We welcome submissions that learn from or inform public policy;
            - Potential for creating interdisciplinary collaborations. We welcome submissions with the potential to spark collaborations across different fields;
            - Presentation of domain-specific knowledge. We especially welcome practitioners with interest or experience in translating between policy issues and academic research approaches
- **Problem Pitches and Demonstrations**:
    - Submissions will be evaluated based on their contributions to one or more of the following:
        - Novelty of problem/domain to the MD4SG community and the broader fields of computer science, economics and operations research.
        - Comprehensive exposition of background on problem and attempted solutions.
        - Potential for future collaborations and/or follow up from the MD4SG community and policymakers.
        - Discussion of practical, structural and/or societal challenges in attempted or proposed solutions.

**Submission Instructions:**
Authors should upload a PDF of their paper to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=md4sg20). There are no specific formatting instructions or length requirements.

### Stephanie Dinkins, Artist Fellow at the Berggruen Institute

![Stephanie Dinkins](../../assets/events/md4sg2020/imgs/stephanie.jpg "Stephanie Dinkins")

Bio: [Stephanie Dinkins](https://www.stephaniedinkins.com/) is a transmedia artist who creates platforms for dialog about artificial intelligence (AI) as it intersects race, gender, aging, and our future histories. She is particularly driven to work with communities of color to co-create more inclusive, fair and ethical artificial intelligent ecosystems. Dinkins’ art practice employs lens-based practices, emerging technologies and community engagement to confront questions of bias in AI, consciousness, data sovereignty and social equity. Investigations into the contradictory histories, traditions, knowledge bases and philosophies that form/in-form society at large underpin her thought and art production. Dinkins earned an MFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 1997 and is an alumna of the Whitney Independent Studies Program. She exhibits and publicly advocates for inclusive AI internationally at a broad spectrum of community, private and institutional venues – by design. Dinkins is a 2019 Creative Capital Grantee as well as a 2018/19 Soros Equality Fellow, Data and Society Research Institute Fellow and 2018 Sundance New Frontiers Story Lab Fellow.

**Community, Craft, and the Vernacular in Artificial Intelligence**

Community, Craft, and the Vernacular in Artificial Intelligence takes the position that everyone participating in society is an expert in our experiences within the community infrastructures which inform the makeup of artificially intelligent systems. Although we may not be intellectually aware of jargon used in exclusionary contexts, we share the vernacular of who we are as people and a community and the intimate sense that our data is being used by big entities. Afro-now-ism asks us to ground our understanding by taking the imaginary leap of defining ourselves and our communities outside of systemic oppression in order to craft the systems we'd like to see. Stephanie Dinkins uses her practice as an artist. Stephanie Dinkins will use her practice as an artist working with AI to illustrate these ideas.

### Deborah Estrin, Associate Dean for Impact at Cornell Tech

**Tech in support of caregiving: innovation opportunities and ecosystem challenges**

Caregiving in the home, outside of traditional clinical settings, is a societally-important, yet under-addressed, application domain that is ripe for digital innovation. I will introduce the context of caregiving, example technical opportunities (e.g., precision sensing, mixed reality, conversational agents), and ecosystem challenges (e.g., misaligned incentives in healthcare, commercialization, and research). I will emphasize the centrality of values in design to the framing of technical problems and solutions (e.g., equity, quality of life and work, dignity, privacy) and the need to intentionally make room for innovation framed in terms of Public Interest needs.

### Nicole Immorlica, Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research

Her areas of specialty include social networks and mechanism design. She currently serves as chair of ACM SIGecom, the professional organization for researchers in her field. Nicole received her Ph.D. from MIT in Cambridge, MA in 2005 and then completed three years of postdocs at both Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA and CWI in Amsterdam, Netherlands before accepting a job as an assistant professor at Northwestern University in Chicago, IL in 2008. She joined the Microsoft Research Northeast Labs in 2012.

**Maximizing the Social Good: Markets without Money**

To create a truly sustainable world, we need to generate ample resources and allocate them appropriately. In traditional economics, these goals are achieved using money. However, in many settings of particular social significance, monetary transactions are infeasible, be it due to ethical considerations or technological constraints. In this talk, we will discuss alternatives to money and show how to use them to achieve socially-optimal outcomes. In this talk, we will discuss alternatives to money, including information asymmetry and risk, and show how to use them to achieve socially-optimal outcomes. Information asymmetry enables an informed group to influence a decision maker. This can benefit groups with the power to leverage influence. Using this insight, we study the disparate impact of unequal access to influence. Risk helps determine a person's value for a resource: the more someone is willing to risk for something, the more they value it. Using this insight, we propose an algorithm to find a good assignment of students in school choice programs.

### Anjana Rajan, Chief Technology Officer of Polaris

**How to fight white supremacist extremism while protecting civil liberties: a multidisciplinary approach using technology, research, and policy**

Anjana Rajan is the chief technology officer of Polaris, an NGO based in Washington DC that fights human trafficking and modern slavery. Her expertise is applying cryptography to national security and human rights issues. Earlier this year, Anjana was a tech policy fellow at the Aspen Institute, where she focused on answering a central question: how can we create privacy-preserving ways to prevent mass gun violence caused by white supremacist extremists? This problem is challenging because it touches upon many different complex issues: counterterrorism, gun control policy, domestic violence, privacy & civil liberties, and cryptography. In this talk, Anjana will discuss her solution of confidential digital reporting escrows for witnesses to safely report while ensuring the civil liberties of both the witness and suspect are protected. Her talk will elaborate on the cryptographic design of this solution and will underscore the important intersection of technical expertise, research expertise, and policy expertise.
