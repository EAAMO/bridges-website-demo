time: March 4-5, 2021
place: Virtual (Gather.town platform and Zoom)
description: Externalities shape the data economy as we experience it. Besides uneven market shares, power asymmetries, and high levels of data sharing, little to no reimbursement to data subjects for their contributions are characteristics of this new market. Data externalities, recently theorized in Microeconomics, offer an explanation for the absence of significant reimbursements for data. In this tutorial, we will introduce models in which data externalities arise. Through a series of case studies, we will expose crucial aspects of the contracting environment that aggravate data externalities and allow participants to develop potential interventions. We aim to both translate insights from Microeconomics for the FAccT community and highlight opportunities for further research directions at the interface of market design, fairness, and accountability.

## Workshop Description

Our FAccT 2021 CRAFT session, "Narratives and Counternarratives on Data Practices in the Global South," is an interactive workshop that uses storytelling as a method to question common assumptions around data practices in countries and communities that are often grouped as "the Global South." Building on our current project around [data sharing in Africa](https://facct2021.hotcrp.com/doc/facct2021-final239.pdf?cap=0239alaqgO6lnEe4), -- and our own autoethnographic observations in other countries -- we will provide various theme-based stories that are informed by common narratives around data practices and invite participants to challenge these narratives from various angles including historical contexts and cultures, legal limitations, accessibility, impact assessments, accountability mechanism, and more.

Our post-conference plan is to create "Narratives and Counternarratives on Data Practices in the Global South" story cards. Our hope is that these cards then will be used by data science educators, civil society groups, philanthropic groups, inter-governmental organizations such as the UN agencies to expose them to narratives and counternarratives of data practices in the Global South and inform them about challenges before they embark on any new initiatives or partnerships.

The CRAFT Workshop is taking place on **March 5th, 6-7:30 PM (UTC)**. Registration information can be found on the [ACM FAccT website](https://facctconference.org/2021/registration.html).

*Organized by: Rediet Abebe, Abeba Birhane, George Obaido, Roya Pakzad.*

### Workshop Description
Externalities shape the data economy as we experience it. Besides uneven market shares, power asymmetries, and high levels of data sharing, little to no reimbursement to data subjects for their contributions are characteristics of this new market. Data externalities, recently theorized in Microeconomics, offer an explanation for the absence of significant reimbursements for data. In this tutorial, we will introduce models in which data externalities arise. Through a series of case studies, we will expose crucial aspects of the contracting environment that aggravate data externalities and allow participants to develop potential interventions. We aim to both translate insights from Microeconomics for the FAccT community and highlight opportunities for further research directions at the interface of market design, fairness, and accountability.
