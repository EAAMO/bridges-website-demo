The MD4SG community aims to bridge research and practice, but many researchers have few opportunities to connect with practitioners. The aim of this working group is to learn from practitioners. We want to know their story, understand their main challenges, and discover if tools from mechanism design apply to their domain.

For our purposes, we define a practitioner as any person who works with (or on policy related to) marginalized and disadvantaged communities.

The group meets every two weeks. At each meeting, a group member will invite a practitioner for an informal live interview with the group (similar to a "fireside chat"). After the interview, we summarise the main insights into a blog post.
