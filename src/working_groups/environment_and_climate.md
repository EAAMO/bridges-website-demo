The environment and climate working group aims to address environmental challenges, particularly those that exacerbate the climate crisis, through the lens of computational and economic lenses. We are a diverse group of researchers from a variety of academic disciplines and geographic locations.

### **Syllabus for Fall 2022**

This semester we plan to emphasize applications of **Algorithmic Game Theory**, **AI/ML**, **optimization**, and **remote sensing** to the fields of **environmental conservation and planning**. This list of topics is intentionally broad, so we encourage members with even tangentially related interests to engage with the group. We seek to provide a platform for members to share their research and receive feedback from others, in addition to hosting a handful of outside speakers to present on relevant topics. 

If you are looking to join our working group, please reach out to one of the co-organizers. 

### **Previous Syllabus Example: Spring 2022**
  
We plan to cover a wide breadth of topics, focusing on providing a platform for members to share their research and receive feedback from others.  
 
*   Meeting 1: Achieving Net Zero (Topic Lead: Maria Lozano)
    
*   Meeting 2: Floods in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (Topic Lead: Arsal Imtiaz)
    
*   Meeting 3: Towards climate informed decision-making (Topic Lead: Kevin Yarritu)
