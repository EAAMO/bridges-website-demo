The MD4SG Healthcare working group comprises researchers from many different academic disciplines, research institutions, and countries. We share a common research interest in healthcare and are working on real-world healthcare market design problems, such as risk adjustment and kidney exchange. We are particularly interested in exploring new frontiers of healthcare research at the intersection of computer science, operations research, and economics, as well as identifying new possibilities to improve fairness and efficiency in healthcare systems through market-based approaches.
