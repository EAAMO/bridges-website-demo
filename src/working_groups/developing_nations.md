The MD4SG Development working group fosters collaboration and discussion amongst practitioners and academics to understand and tackle issues pertaining to the role and application of technology in addressing challenges in emerging nations and under-resourced settings. We study how techniques from algorithm and mechanism design, computational social science, and optimization can inform and help advance existing development policies and practices.

### **Ongoing Projects**

**Vaccine sharing behaviour in the COVID-19 pandemic: the impact of narratives and peer effects**

*   *Authors:* Michelle González Amador, Simon Finster, Edwin Lock
*   *Project Summary:* Our incentivised experiment provides evidence that the willingness to give towards vaccines in low- and middle-income countries is guided more strongly by altruism than self-interest, and is influenced by peer effects. In our study, more than 800 GBP were donated to the COVAX vaccine access initiative.

**Directory to Promote Collaboration**

*   *Project Summary:* One of the challenges of enacting MD4SG is often making connections. Our goal is to create a directory to support making connections between researchers, stakeholders, and students from all over the world. We hope this will lower the barrier to starting this important work.
