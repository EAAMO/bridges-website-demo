### Overview

The MD4SG Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) group aims to develop a new topical focus on issues relevant to the region. This semester’s focus will be on addressing challenges through a  social cohesion and integration lens. Major themes include: migration (especially the Venezuelan diaspora) and education (leveraging technology to help students that were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic). We welcome members to join our upcoming bilingual (English and Spanish) meetings. Currently our capacity for new members is small due to the new nature of the group, but our goal is to grow throughout 2021, so please feel free to reach out to learn more about our schedule and how to get involved over the year.

### Structure

The main forum of discussion for these topics will be bi-weekly meetings of an hour in length. Each meeting will address a different topic (the list of which can be found on the website), and we expect members of the group to prepare short presentations on relevant papers to kick-start discussions for each meeting. In addition, for select topics we will also bring guest speakers who are experts in the field to share their work with us.

### Topics / Selected Papers

The following papers are examples of the types of paper we are thinking of reading together. We note that this list is not exhaustive, and we do not expect members to have read these papers prior to joining the group.
