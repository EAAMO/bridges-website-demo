The MD4SG Bias, Discrimination, and Fairness working group examines the various social ramifications of technological systems that are deployed in real-world settings. We are especially concerned with the perpetuation and normalization of socially unjust practices that occur when seemingly objective tools embed and operate from biased understandings of the world. Drawing on a variety of academic disciplines, we turn our focus inward to assess how various technical approaches can and cannot be more thoughtfully designed and implemented so to prevent the further marginalization of our most vulnerable communities.

Our group consists of bi-weekly seminar-style talks of recent work, project proposals, and subarea overviews.  Below are some examples from Spring 2020:
