The data economies and data governance working group aims to better understand the challenges that arise across the data pipeline from creation, ownership, accessibility, and sharing to data analysis and use. We are especially interested in understanding how access and sharing affect the benefits of the global data economy, and whether benefits are distributed evenly among communities in the Global North and South. In addition to data accessibility, sharing and data colonialism, we study related topics such as privacy, security, and the cultural norms that govern these practices.

The project page for the group is available at this [link](../projects/data_stories).
