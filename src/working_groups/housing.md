The MD4SG Housing working group brings together researchers from the fields of computer science, operations research, and economics who share a deep interest in affordable housing policy. We study how recent techniques in mechanism design, algorithmic game theory, machine learning, and econometrics can shed light on affordable housing issues such as efficiently allocating affordable housing services, enforcing fair housing laws, and reducing housing instability. More broadly, we are interested in how to design incentives to increase fairness and efficiency in housing markets.
